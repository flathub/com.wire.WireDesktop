== Build, Install and Run Flatpak (locally)

Assuming `flatpak`, `flatpak-builder`, and `git` are installed, execute the following commands:

[source,shellscript]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/flathub/com.wire.WireDesktop.git
$ cd com.wire.WireDesktop/
$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
$ flatpak-builder build --force-clean --install-deps-from=flathub --install --user com.wire.WireDesktop.yaml

# ...to uninstall the artifact
$ flatpak uninstall --delete-data --user com.wire.WireDesktop

# ...and to clean-up everything
$ rm --force --recursive .flatpak-builder/ build/
$ flatpak uninstall --unused --user
$ flatpak remote-delete --user flathub

== Grant Access to System's Keychain
:uri-electronjs-safe-storage: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/safe-storage/#safestoragegetselectedstoragebackend-linux
:uri-wire-wiki-grant-access-to-system-keychain: https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop/wiki/Grant-access-to-system's-keychain-(Linux)/

With the introduction of Electron's `safeStorage`, Wire requires access to your {uri-wire-wiki-grant-access-to-system-keychain}[system's keychain^].

Ensure that your desktop environment has a compatible keychain supported by Electron.
Then set the `WIRE_SECRET_STORE` environment variable to {uri-wire-wiki-grant-access-to-system-keychain}[specify which keychain^] to use.
This will ensure that the `--password-store` argument is set correctly.
